Tiny Spot
======================

The repository contains the files to my tiny house sharing community website Tiny Spot. The goal of the project was to create an environment where tiny house owners/builders/enthusiasts could share in there tiny house adventures. As a tiny haouse builder and owner myself I thought it would be nice to have a place where people could come together and share there stories. I have also added a forum where people can go and start topics and expand on anything they wish to talk about.
